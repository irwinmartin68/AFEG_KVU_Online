AFEG KVU™ – Knowledge Value Unit Framework

1. Overview

AFEG KVU™ is a technical and governance framework designed to measure, log, and quantify AI economic activity in a verifiable, auditable, and privacy-preserving way.

Not a generative AI model — AFEG KVU™ captures AI activity, not proprietary data.

Converts AI inference, reasoning, and memory operations into standardized Knowledge Value Units (KVUs).

Core goal: Provide transparency and accountability for AI outputs, enabling regulators, enterprises, and policymakers to monitor AI economic value at scale.

2. Core Features

Real-Time Event Capture: Tracks AI inference, reasoning steps, and memory usage during operations.

Immutable Ledger: KVUs are hashed (e.g., SHA-256) and stored in an auditable chain.

Governance & Compliance Layer: Flags risky AI outputs while maintaining full KVU records.

Aggregated Fiscal Metrics: Computes high-level economic proxies like AI GDP or VAT equivalents without exposing model outputs.

Policy-Ready & Privacy-Preserving: Operates in anonymized or aggregated mode; no content surveillance.

Scalable Simulation: Supports surge testing and 24/7 operational validation.

3. Use Cases

Domain

Application

Government / Treasury

Measure and audit national AI economic activity.

Regulators

Provide auditable evidence for compliance and market oversight.

Enterprises

Quantify AI productivity and cost efficiency without exposing proprietary logic.

Public Policy

Inform AI taxation, infrastructure planning, and economic contribution tracking.

4. Technical Architecture

AI Activity Hooks: Capture inference calls, memory use, and reasoning steps in real time.

KVU Processor: Converts captured events into standard Knowledge Value Units.

Immutable Storage: Hashes KVUs and appends them to a tamper-evident ledger.

Governance Engine: Flags outputs against configurable compliance rules.

Analytics & Dashboards: Aggregates KVUs into economic, compliance, and operational metrics.


5. Security & Compliance

Fully aligned with UK and GCC data governance principles.

No training data or proprietary model outputs are captured or exposed.

Supports audit, traceability, and regulatory readiness.

6. Licensing & IP

All IP remains with AFEG KVU™ (Martin Irwin).

Users can operate, but cannot sublicense, transfer, or sell the product or derivatives.

Designed for enterprise and government deployment with clear ownership and audit rights.

7. Next Steps / Roadmap

Pilot deployments with regulatory or enterprise partners.

Integration with national AI sandboxes (e.g., UAE, Saudi Arabia).

Enhanced KVU analytics for revenue, taxation, and compliance reporting.

Open API for controlled telemetry integration with AI platforms.
